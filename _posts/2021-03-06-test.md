In this blog post, I will describe how to set up a multi-physics simulation to model a photonic device. This type of device modeling is required when we need to analyze the behavior of a device, say a modulator in which the device state is changed by applying some external signal, for example, an electrical signal. And this electrical signal produces temperature change in the device, which alters the device's optical output. So, these types of devices can be analyzed by modeling them using a combined simulation in CST. 
## Setting up the simulations
