Welcome!!! My name is Lateef Ahmad Wani. I completed my Ph.D. from the department of [Mathematics](https://iitr.ac.in/Departments/Mathematics%20Department/Home.html) at [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in Complex Analysis (Geometric Function Theory). I earned my MSc in Mathematics from the [University of Kashmir](https://www.kashmiruniversity.net/).

My [research](https://nadiralii.github.io//research) involves modeling, simulations, and custom algorithm development for novel photonic device design and scientific analysis. I am currently focusing on designing hybrid silicon photonic devices based on non-volatile phase change materials. 

I also work as a technical consultant for businesses. If you need my help, you can contact me on [Kolabtree](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/nadir-ali/) profile or through email - nadir.ali19@gmail.com.
