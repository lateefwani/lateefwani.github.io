Welcome! I am currently a PhD student at the [Department of Physics](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) of
[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), working in the field of photonics. I earned
my BSc and MSc in Physics from the
[Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/).

My [research](research) involves modeling, simulations, and custom algorithm development for novel photonic device design and scientific analysis. I have designed active photonic components such as modulators, switches, couplers, and resonators for the silicon photonic platform. My research focuses on developing hybrid silicon photonic devices using phase change material for high-density photonic integrated circuits applications.
