Welcome! I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), working in the field of photonics. I earned
my BSc and MSc in Physics from the
[Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/).

My [research](research) involves modeling, simulations, and custom algorithm development for novel photonic device design and scientific analysis. I am currently focusing on the design of hybrid silicon photonic devices based on non-volatile phase change materials.
