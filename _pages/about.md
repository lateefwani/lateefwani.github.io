Welcome! My name is Nadir Ali. I completed my Ph.D. from the department of physics at [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in photonics. I earned my BSc and MSc in Physics from the [Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/).

My [research](https://nadiralii.github.io//research) involves modeling, simulations, and custom algorithm development for novel photonic device design and scientific analysis. I am currently focusing on designing hybrid silicon photonic devices based on non-volatile phase change materials. I specialize in electromagnetic modelling of optoelectronic and photonic devices using commercial software like CST Microwave Studio and COMSOL Multiphysics. 

I also work as a technical consultant for businesses. If you need my help, you can contact me on [Kolabtree](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/nadir-ali/) profile or through email - nadir.ali19@gmail.com.
