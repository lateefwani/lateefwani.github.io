Welcome! I am currently a PhD student at the [Department of Physics](https://www.iitr.ac.in/),
[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). I am working in the field of photonics. I earned
my BSc and MSc in Physics from the
[Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/).

My [research](research) involves modeling, simulations, and custom algorithm development for novel photonic device design and scientific analysis. I am currently focusing on the design of hybrid silicon photonic devices based on phase change material.
