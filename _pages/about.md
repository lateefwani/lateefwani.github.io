Welcome! I am a Research Fellow in the
[Department of Physics](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) at
[Indian Institute of Technology Rorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). I am working in the field of active silicon photonics. I earned
my BSc and MSc in Physics from the
[Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/).

My [research](research) explores the
design and simulation of active silicon photonic devices using phase change materials.
