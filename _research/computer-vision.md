The phase change material GST exhibits high contrast in refractive index on switching between its amorphous and crystalline phases. By embedding the GST in the SOI waveguide, we designed photonic switches for the Mid-IR wavelengths. The light passing through the hybrid waveguide experience different absorption. In the amorphous phase, the light passed through the waveguide without much attenuation, hence a high transmission state. In contrast, in the crystalline phase, the light passing through the waveguide is highly attenuated due to the high extinction coefficient of the crystalline phase. By switching the phase of the GST via electrical signal, the device transmission can be switched between the high and low transmission states.
